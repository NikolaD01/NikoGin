# NikoGin - WordPress Plugin Generator

##  Introduction
NikoGin automates the creation of a structured WordPress plugin, ensuring best practices in directory setup, class generation, and Composer integration. It emphasizes:

- Dependency injection

- Autoloading via Composer
- CLI-based plugin creation

##  Features
-  Generates a complete WordPress plugin structure.
-  Includes service providers for dependency management.

- ðŸ–¥ Provides a CLI command to create a new plugin.

##  Installation
To install this package via Composer, run:
```sh
composer require nikogin/plugin-generator
```

### Notice !!!
Since **NikoGin** is still in development some things still needs to be polished,
for current use its best to install **NikoGin** inside **wp-content/plugins** folder and add to **.gitignore**,
when I manage to put it to composer, It will be moved as global package.

Important thing now is also that most bootstrap inside plugin will be needed to be done manually what does that mean ?
For example when you create multiple **Providers** you will need to manually add them to providers in **ProviderManager** inside **Core** of framework.

In future all of this will be covered for now just keep in mind that some things need manual setup. 
Enjoy programing :)

**FE** \
Idea here is when we want to create new plugin, we can have starter kits or none.
With starter kits we can choose how we will make dashboards and what would be used as bundler.
For example goal is that user can choose react, twig or base php , so for react we can use wp-scripts,
for twig or php we can use vite with typescript , and at end user can choose vanilla js without bundlers
